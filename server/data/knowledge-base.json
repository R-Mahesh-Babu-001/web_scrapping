          "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed from a theoretical concept to a practical technology that powers many aspects of modern life. From natural language processing to computer vision, AI systems can now perform tasks that were once thought to require human intelligence. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved remarkable results in image recognition, speech processing, and language understanding. The field continues to advance rapidly, with new breakthroughs in generative AI, reinforcement learning, and multimodal models.",

The shift from agrarian economies to industrial manufacturing brought about unprecedented changes in production, transportation, and daily life. Key innovations included the steam engine, spinning jenny, power loom, and later the internal combustion engine. While the revolution brought economic growth and technological progress, it also led to urbanization challenges, labor exploitation, environmental pollution, and social inequality.

Active recall, where you test yourself on material rather than passively re-reading, is one of the most effective study techniques. Spaced repetition, reviewing information at increasing intervals, helps transfer knowledge to long-term memory. The Feynman Technique involves explaining concepts in simple terms to identify gaps in understanding. Breaking study sessions into focused intervals (like the Pomodoro Technique) helps maintain concentration. Connecting new information to existing knowledge, teaching others, and practicing retrieval all enhance learning outcomes.",
